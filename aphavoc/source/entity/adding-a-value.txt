To add a new value to an entity follow these steps (yes it's cumbersome!)

* add a type and bits to entity/system/en_funcs/en_<type>.h
* add packing info to entity/system/en_type.c
* add a variable of correct type to the struct which needs it (e.g. in
struct HELICOPTER in helicop.h if it's a value every helicopter should have)
* add type to structtype_create
* add type to structtype_pack/unpack - important that pack and unpack have values in same order!
* add type to structtype_attrs
* add overload for attrs to set/get attr functions
* check if new gwut needed
