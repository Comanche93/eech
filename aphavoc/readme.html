      THIS IS A TEST RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN NUMEROUS BUGS<br>

    <hr>

    <p>
      This file is a summary of the new features provided with this
      release of COHOKUM.EXE. This document was mostly taken from the
      Wiki at the EECH DevZone (<a href="http://eech.bollocks.net.nz">http://eech.bollocks.net.nz</a>). Further
      information about the EECH Community Development Program and new
      releases of COHOKUM.EXE are available from that website.

    <a name="installation"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
      Simply copy the file cohokum.exe into your /razorwroks/cohokum
      directory. You may want to rename your old cohokum.exe to save
      it. 
      Note that if the eech.ini file does not exist it will be generated automatically. If you run into trouble it may be a good idea to delete the eech.ini file. <br>
      If you have trouble configuring your joystick in eech.ini you can use a tool made by Retro (eechmap.exe). <br>
  Read also the next paragraph for loadout screens.</p>
    <p><a name="choppers" id="choppers"></a>    </p>
  <h2>Flyable choppers</h2>
    <p>As of version W12 you can fly,  change the loadout  and repair the following choppers: Comanche, Apache, Hokum, Havoc, Blackhawk, Hind, AH64-A, and KA50. The cockpits and the flight behaviour of the new blue choppers default to the Apache, of the red choppers to the Havok. 
  Make sure you download and install the additional download screens here: <a href="http://eech.bollocks.net.nz" target="_blank">http://eech.bollocks.net.nz</a> (in the addon download area). These zips have the full installation path , the files should go here: &quot;\Razorworks\cohokum\graphics\ui\cohokum\Map\&quot;.</p>
    <p>Note that you can pick a returning chopper to fly rogue. Spot the wanted Helo in the 2D-map, click on it, accept,confirm and off you go (you can't choose it from the mission or group list since it has no task). </p>
    <p><a name="MP" id="MP"></a> </p>
    <h2>Multiplayer status </h2>
  <p>No changes compared to 160w11. Bug hunting conitnues</p>
    <a name="bugs"></a>
    <h2>Bugs</h2>

    
    <p> This version seems to be pretty stable, both as single and multiplayer. If 
  you find any bugs/odd behaviour please report them at one of the forums:<br>
      <a href="http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=30">http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=30</a><br>
      <a href="http://forum.biohazcentral.com/viewforum.php?f=42">http://forum.biohazcentral.com/viewforum.php?f=42</a><br>
      <a href="http://forums.frugalsworld.com/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=fe2daac7867adaffe2ad8cf4fa8e6738&forumid=27">http://forums.frugalsworld.com/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=fe2daac7867adaffe2ad8cf4fa8e6738&forumid=27</a>
  </p>

    <p>
      Note: two infamous bugs have been more or less solved: the "FARP" bug
      that caused helicopters to cue at landing pads, and the "double
      mouse" bug.

	      levels. When using the keyboard, you still use the same
	      keys to zoom, but you now have 5 levels instead. If you
	      have an extra joystick axis available you can map one of
