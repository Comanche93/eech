    <p>
      This file is a summary of the new features provided with this
      release of COHOKUM.EXE. This document was mostly taken from the
      Wiki at the EECH DevZone (<a href="http://eech.bollocks.net.nz">http://eech.bollocks.net.nz</a>). Further
      information about the EECH Community Development Program and new
      releases of COHOKUM.EXE are available from that website.

    <h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

    <p>
      Simply copy the file cohokum.exe into your /razorwroks/cohokum
      directory. You may want to rename your old cohokum.exe to save
      it.
    </p>

    <h2>BUGS</h2>

    
<p> This version seems to be pretty stable, both as single and multiplayer. If 
  you find any bugs/odd behaviour please report them at one of the forums:<br>
      <a href="http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=30">http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=30</a><br>

    </p>

    <p>
      Note: two infamous bugs have been more or less solved: the "FARP" bug
      that caused helicopters to cue at landing pads, and the "double
      mouse" bug.

	    You can now control you view using the mouse or by using
	    TrackIR. The TrackIR support uses enhanced mode which
	    means that you will not have to bother about centering you
	    view all the time. A check will be made for a TrackIR upon
	    startup, and if it is found it will be used to control the
	    view. Otherwise the mouse is used. (default = 0, off)

	    <p>
	      Pressing the left mouse button will recenter the view to
	      forward.

	    <p>
	      You can set the speed of the mouselookwich should be a
	      value greater than 0 (default = 15).

	      The old FLIR code only allowed three levels of
	      zoom. This code has been updated to support any zoom
	      levels. When using the keyboard, you still use the same
	      keys to zoom, but you now have 5 levels instead. If you
	      have an extra joystick axis available you can map one of
	      them to the zoom and using for zooming.

      is blue. The maximum elevation of the map is used to scale the colours. 
      Shaded relief is also added as an option.

          set the eech.ini variable "tsdenemy" to 0.
