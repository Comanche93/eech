How to make an allMods package
==============================

First of all, make sure you have installed NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download).

First download the latest available allMods package and install it in this directory (allMods).
When you've done that you should have the subfolders cohokum, common and Russian Translation
(plus whatever more folders have been added since these instructions were written).

Just to make sure that everything is working you can try to compile the eech-allMmods.nsi script
(should work to right click it and select "Compile NSIS script").  If it doesn't work, then
check that you really have the latest allMods package (it should have the same version number
as the one defined at the top of the NSIS script).  If the NSIS script is older than the
allMods package you have installed, and you've made sure you have pulled from git recently, then
someone hasn't done their job properly and haven't checked in the script after last release.
If you know who made the previous release you can try to contact him/her and ask if they can
check in the last version.  Otherwise you have some work ahead of you to figure out what has been
added since the last script you have...

Adding new and changed files
============================

When you're creating a new allMods it's probably because there are some new files which have been
added or files which have been changed since last release.  After all, there wouldn't be much point
in creating a new package if there were no changes.

If files have been changed, all you have to do is copy the new files to the appropriate sub
directory.  If files have been added you copy it to the correct sub directory, but you must
also add it to the NSIS script so that the installer will install it.  Add it in the appropriate
place in the NSIS file (you see the syntax from the existing entries there), it's sorted 
alphabethically.  If your files goes to a directory were no files are already being installed
then you will also have to add a SetOutPath line with the directory before the list of files
(once again, see how it's done for the previous objects).

Finally
=======

Make sure you have changed the version number at the top of the NSIS script before you create
the final package.  Then compile the NSIS script, correct any errors, test the allMods package
on a clean install of EECH.  If everything works as expected it's probably ready for release! :)

After you've created and released your allMods version, make sure to
commit and push your latest version of the NSIS script to the git repository so that the next
person making an allMods package can benefit from your work and not have to re-do it!
