This file explains how to compile the EECH source code with the Watcom compiler. 
Note that distribution and use of this source code is subject to the rules that 
are specified in each of the files.

1)	Unpack the source code in a directory of your own choice, for instance 
..\razorworks. This will create a directory tree called "\razorwokrs\eech-new" 
with the subdirectories:
eech-new\aphavoc       => the main game code
eech-new\masterserver  => master server code
eech-new\modules       => graphics stuff and in/output of gamedata
eech-new\setup         => replica of the cohokum game directory, used for creating setup files

2)	Download and install the watcom open source compiler: 
http://www.openwatcom.org/

3)	Download and install the DirectX: www.windows.com/directx. Click on the 
download in the menu untill you find the SDK, soft ware development kit. You can 
download and use DX9 although cohokum will actually use the DX7 libraries.

Now you have to do 5 things and then you are set:
1)	Go to eech-new\modules and make a directory "linklib". Copy all DX libraries 
form the directx SDK directory \dsdsk\lib into the directory \eech-
new\modules\linklib (you can ignore the directory dssdk\lib\x64).

2)	Copy all header files from the directx SDK directory \dsdsk\include into the 
watcom header diectory: \watcom\h\nt\ (you can ignore the directory 
\dsdsk\include\DShowIDL).


3)	Copy the file dsound.lib from watcom\lib386\nt\ to the directory 
\modules\linklib and overwrite the version from dx9.

4)	Find the file float.h in the directory \watcom\h and find the variable 
FLT_MAX (around line 99)  and decrease its value a bit: #define FLT_MAX 
3.402823e+38f 

5)	You have to set an environment variable called EECH_ROOTDIR with the path to 
your eech-new directory. You can do this as follows: go to the eech-new\aphavoc 
and open the file cmake.bat in a text editor. If your directory is for instance 
"c:\razorworks\eech-new", add a line: set EECH_ROOTDIR= c:\razorworks\eech-new 
If you use any of the other batch file you have to add this line to those files 
too. You can also define the environment variable in windows by going to the 
control panel->system->advanced->environment variables.

You are now set to compile cohokum. This is done by running the cmake batch file 
for the regulat version, the dmake.batch file for a debug version, and a 
remake.bat file which deletes all temporary files and cleaning the eech-new 
dirs. 

A final note: we kindly ask you not to distribute any executables without some 
concensus from everyone working on the source code. This avoids a lot of 
confusion. So if you have something to contrbute, please join the developers 
community via the EECH devzone http://eech.bollocks.net.nz/, or contact us via 
the eech forum at www.simhq.com.

thanks and have fun.
